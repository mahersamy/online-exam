### Feature Organization

**📁 Features Structure (`features/pages/`)**

Each feature follows Clean Architecture layers within its own bounded context:


**🏠 Home Feature**
- Dashboard components and services


**🎯 Quizs Feature**
- Quiz-specific domain logic separate from exams
- Quiz use cases and workflows
- Quiz UI components

### Shared Resources

**🔄 Shared Components (`shared/components/`)**
- Reusable UI components across features
- Form controls, modals, data tables, loading indicators

**🔗 Shared Interfaces (`shared/interfaces/`)**
- Cross-feature contracts and interfaces
- API response structures, pagination, form configurations

**📐 Shared Layouts (`shared/layouts/`)**
- Common layout components
- Header, sidebar, footer components

**⚙️ Shared Services (`shared/services/`)**
- Cross-cutting services
- Toast notifications, validation, utilities

## 🔧 Architecture Components

### Core Architecture Elements

**🔌 Adapters Layer (`core/adaptors/`)**
- **Purpose**: Isolate external dependencies and provide consistent interfaces
- **Key Adapters**: HTTP client, Storage, Authentication, Notification adapters
- **Benefit**: Easy to swap implementations and mock for testing

**🏗️ Base Layer (`core/base/`)**
- **Purpose**: Provide common abstractions and base classes
- **Components**: Base repository, Base component, Base service, Base entity
- **Benefit**: Reduces code duplication and enforces consistent patterns

**📝 Enums (`core/enums/`)**
- **Purpose**: Define domain-specific enumerations and constants
- **Examples**: User roles, Exam status, Question types, Response status
- **Benefit**: Type safety and consistent value definitions

**🛡️ Guards (`core/guards/`)**
- **Purpose**: Protect routes and enforce access control
- **Types**: Authentication, Role-based access, Feature-specific guards
- **Integration**: Works with the adapter pattern for authentication

**🔄 Interceptors (`core/interceptors/`)**
- **Purpose**: Handle cross-cutting concerns for HTTP requests
- **Functions**: Authentication tokens, Error handling, Loading states
- **Architecture**: Uses adapters for consistent behavior

**🔗 Interfaces (`core/interfaces/`)**
- **Purpose**: Define contracts between layers
- **Types**: Repository contracts, Adapter contracts, Use case contracts
- **Benefit**: Enables dependency inversion and loose coupling

## 🎯 Architecture Benefits

### ✅ **Clean Separation of Concerns**
- **Domain**: Pure business logic, no framework dependencies
- **Application**: Orchestrates business workflows
- **Infrastructure**: Handles technical details through adapters
- **Presentation**: UI concerns only

### ✅ **Adapter Pattern Benefits**
- **Decoupling**: External services are isolated behind interfaces
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations (HTTP → GraphQL → Mock)
- **Testing**: Mock adapters for unit testing
- **Resilience**: Fallback adapters for error handling

### ✅ **Testability**
- Each layer can be tested in isolation using the adapter pattern
- Mock adapters for external dependencies
- Clear separation between business logic and technical concerns

### ✅ **Technology Independence**
- Business logic isolated from Angular-specific code
- Adapters can be swapped without changing core logic
- Easy migration to different frameworks or technologies

### ✅ **Scalability**
- Feature-based organization supports team development
- Clear boundaries between different domains
- Shared resources prevent code duplication

### ✅ **Bounded Contexts**
Each feature (auth, exam, student, admin) is a self-contained bounded context with its own:
- Domain models
- Business rules  
- Data access patterns
- UI components

## 📊 Architecture Benefits

Your implementation provides several advantages through the combination of Clean Architecture and Adapter Pattern:

### **🔌 Adapter Pattern Benefits**
- **Isolation**: External services isolated behind consistent interfaces
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations without changing business logic  
- **Testing**: Simple to mock external dependencies
- **Maintenance**: Changes to external APIs only affect the adapter layer

### **🏗️ Clean Architecture Benefits**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level details
- **Technology Independence**: Core business logic is framework-agnostic
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries make code easier to understand and modify
